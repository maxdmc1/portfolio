This project is a three page website designed to showcase many of the features learned in the first 4 days of Coding Bootcamp.  HTML and CSS are the primary focus.


CSS Positioning is the main item that I am still struggling with at the end of this exersize. for example on the Portfolio page the three "projects" the css is written that each box is positioned relatively to its parent (the .content class).  My confusion comes in when the content box is not adjusting to the content which is inside that <div>.  I have written the banners to each be positioned absolutely to their parents (which is the photo that they are associated with).
